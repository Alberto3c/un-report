This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")

```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot}
# Make plot of GDP vs. LifeExp
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997)+ 
         aes(x = gdpPercap , y = lifeExp)+
         labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life Expectancy")+
